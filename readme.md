I will be adding more to this readme file later but for right now if you want to look at my report,
 **read the .XLS file** in this folder
 
 Next Steps:
Efficiency
 - Decrease data loss from YFinance lookup
 - Increase number of Parse Objects for .txt files
 - implement a mySQL server to handle all portfolios with a single to multiple system where the initial chart contains a list of dates and core stats then be able  to lookup (statistics, change in holdings, holdings, data table, etc.)

Data Value
 - Add a comparison of portfolios based on net positions (what stocks were added, what stocks were changed)
 - Add Tableau data charts for my front-end report
 - Clean up statistics labels
 - write more conclusive report
 
 Excel
 - Clarify the scope of my analysis
